# Prerequisites

## Labctl

You'll need to have [labctl](ttps://github.com/iximiuz/labctl) installed, so go ahead and do that first.

Once you have it installed, set up an account at [labs.iximiuz.com](https://labs.iximiuz.com). You only need a GitHub username. It's possible that you _might_ get flagged as a potential bot, but if you do, just send a message in the Discord server and you can get unblocked.
