# Prerequisites

## Labctl

You'll need to have [labctl](ttps://github.com/iximiuz/labctl) installed, so go ahead and do that first.

Once you have it installed, set up an account at [labs.iximiuz.com](https://labs.iximiuz.com). You only need a GitHub username. It's possible that you _might_ get flagged as a potential bot, but if you do, just send a message in the Discord server and you can get unblocked.

Yes, this is literally the only prerequisite! Since we're installing all the tooling on one of the remote servers, you can just run all the commands there, and we don't put anything else on your local workstation.

The current walkthrough was done with `labctl` version `0.1.44`.
